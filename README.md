# CineSeat-Manager
This C++ project handles seat reservations in a cinema. It allows users to view, book, and cancel seats while ensuring proper availability checks. Using a 2D array to represent the cinema layout, the system prevents double bookings and provides a simple, user-friendly interface for managing seat status efficiently.
